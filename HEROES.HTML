<P>"This colossal menace soaks up huge amount of damage and bashes anything in his path. He guards his territory fiercely when defending, and can launch into a devastating rage when attacking once his Iron Fist ability is unlocked!"
The Barbarian King is basically a larger, more aggressive, and more powerful
Barbarian. He is automatically summoned once the Barbarian King Altar is constructed, which costs 10,000 Dark Elixir.
The Barbarian King is an immortal unit, so he only has to be summoned once. However, if he is injured or falls in battle, he must regenerate his health by sleeping for a period of time before he can be used again. If you attack a village while its Barbarian King is still regenerating, the Altar will be empty.
The amount of time he sleeps to regenerate is directly proportional to the health he has lost by the end of the battle. If he is not damaged (or is fully healed before the battle ends), then he is ready to fight immediately; however, if he falls in battle or is wounded, then he must sleep for some time to regenerate.
The more the Barbarian King is upgraded, the more time it will take to fully regenerate his health.
The Barbarian King sleeps during the time it takes to upgrade along with the normal costs (a free Builder , Dark Elixir and time).
You can temporarily quadruple the hero's healing rate for 1 hour by spending 5
Gems .
The Barbarian King now only defends his territory around his platform and will retreat if lured too far out.
Starting at level 5, the Barbarian King obtains an ability called Iron Fist which can be used on the battlefield. It partially heals him, summons up to twenty-two additional Barbarians and grants the Barbarian King and any surrounding
Barbarians increased damage and speed. This does not stack with the Rage Spell , and does not affect any other troops except the Barbarian King and nearby (friendly) Barbarians . This ability gets more powerful every fifth level.</P>

<p>The Archer Queen is an eagle-eyed warrior, and big enough to carry a modified X-Bow that few men could dream of wielding. When she’s not getting her beauty rest, she can attack enemy villages and guard yours. Unlock her Royal Cloak ability at Level 5 to make her invisible to enemy defenses and summon fellow archers to her side.




The Archer Queen is basically a stronger, more powerful version of the Archer .
She is automatically summoned once the Archer Queen Altar is constructed, which costs 40,000 Dark Elixir.
The Archer Queen is an immortal unit, so she only has to be summoned once. However, if she is injured or 'falls' in battle, she must regenerate her health by sleeping for a period of time before she can be used again. If you attack a village while its Archer Queen is still regenerating, the Altar will be empty.
The amount of time she sleeps to regenerate is directly proportional to the health she has left at the end of the battle. So if she is not damaged then she is ready to fight immediately; however, if she falls in battle or even gets hit, then she must sleep for some time to regenerate.
The more the Archer Queen is upgraded, the more time it will take to fully regenerate her health.
You can temporarily quadruple the hero's healing rate for 1 hour by spending 5
Gems .
As in the January 29th 2014 update, the Archer Queen gained a new special ability: Royal Cloak. The Royal Cloak allows her to become "invisible" to enemy
defenses for a short period of time, in addition to greatly increasing her damage, restoring some of her health and summoning up to 12 Archers to aid her in battle (although the Archers are summoned by Royal Cloak, they are otherwise unaffected by it unlike the Barbarian King , where barbarians are affected). The Archer Queen gains this ability at Level 5, and it becomes more powerful every five levels she gains.
Unlike the Barbarian King , the Archer Queen can attack air units like Balloons ,
Dragons , or Minions , making her effective in guarding a village against players who conduct air raids.</p>
