<LI>The levels 1-8 Town Halls were added in the original release (date varies depending on platform and country).</LI>
<LI>The level 9 Town Hall was added as a part of the 27/10/12 "Dark Castle" update (Version 2.86).</LI>
<LI>The level 10 Town Hall was added as a part of the 23/5/13 "Fiery Fortress" update (Version 4.14).</LI>
<LI>The level 11 Town Hall was added as a part of the 10/12/15 update.</LI>
</OL>
<P>This same update also made the town hall a resource building, and can now be targeted by Goblins .
Also, Town Hall Level 10's cost got increased from 4,000,000 gold to 5,000,000 gold and time decreased from 14 days to 12 days in the same update.
Town Hall 11 had a beta design before it got changed to its released design.
Between November 24 and December 8 of 2014 and 2015, IOS users were able to purchase (RED) gems to contribute to AIDS research. When they did, they received a red shield on their Town Hall.</P>
<P>In an older version, players can sell
buildings but was removed in the 15/10/12 update due to it being unnecessary and due to abuse.
As of the 30/4/15 update, Town Hall level 1's hitpoint has been decreased from 1500 to 450, and most buildings unlocked at Town Hall level 1 have their construction times decreased from 1 minute to 10 seconds. These changes have made the tutorial quicker to finish, as the two Single Player Campaign levels in the tutorial have level 1 Town Halls and quicker to destroy.
Town Halls in the Single Player Campaign , or "Goblin Town Halls", look the same at all levels, but the hitpoints are the same as player Town Halls of equal level. A Goblin Town Hall's level can be observed by the number of
experience points it yields when destroyed.</P>
