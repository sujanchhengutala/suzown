<p>The Barbarian is a kilt-clad Scottish warrior with an angry, battle-ready expression, hungry for destruction. He has close-cropped blonde hair and a long, yellow horseshoe mustache.
The Barbarian is the first troop unlocked in the Barracks .
Barbarians have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building to them. However, once they become aware of enemy Clan Castle
troops, Heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons (either by being attacked themselves or being near another friendly troop under attack), they will leave their previously targeted building and engage the enemy
troops instead. Once all of the nearby enemy troops are defeated, they will proceed to attack the nearest building from their current location.</p>
<p><h4><b>Offensive Strategy<br></b></h4>

<img src="barbarian-thumb.jpg" align="right">

Archers and Giants are commonly used to support Barbarians.
Large hordes of Barbarians are very effective as they will quickly destroy anything in their path. This is balanced by the fact that the Barbarians are not very effective under heavy fire from splash damaging buildings. As such, players sometimes spread Barbarians to avoid them all being picked off in one group by a Mortar , Wizard Tower or Bomb Tower, as they deal splash damage.
Besides doing splash damage, the Mortar also knocks back any Barbarians it strikes by 2 tiles (sometimes this can even change the Barbarians' target, if it moves them closer to another building).</p><p>
Players also sometimes use Barbarians first to test what troops are in the defending player's Clan Castle, where any
Traps are, and where any Hidden Teslas are.
Barbarians can act as a "poor man's" distracting troop in a similar fashion to
Giants ; while they have far less health individually, a group of five Barbarians (the same housing requirement as one
Giant ) has approximately 75% of the health as a similar-level Giant (up to level 5) while doing nearly 4 times the damage (and costing approximately 20-25% of the
Elixir to train). Note that this strategy is far less effective if splash damage
defenses are in the area, as they will damage all Barbarians at once and destroy them relatively quickly.
They are good to take out lone buildings, like Builder's Huts placed far away to prevent full destruction.
If a Mortar is exposed and otherwise undefended, a single Barbarian can easily destroy it as Mortars cannot target troops which are within 4 tiles of them.
Barbarians, along with Archers , are normally used in swarms to defeat
Barbarian King or the Archer Queen . This is because they are inexpensive, and take up the minimum amount of housing space and therefore can be deployed in large numbers; the fact that Hero attacks are single-target means that the Hero can only kill one of the swarming troops at a time.
Barbarians are effectively deployed with the Barbarian King once the King has received his Iron Fist ability. When activated, all nearby Barbarians (not just the ones summoned) will receive bonus speed and damage while they remain in the Barbarian King's circle of rage.
</p><p><p><h4><b>Defensive Strategy<br><br></b></h4>


Barbarians are not too weak for Clan Castle troops as they have relatively high health and damage for single housing space troops. They are capable of soaking up a decent amount of damage, delaying attackers and allowing your fixed
defenses to take care of the rest. Because their housing space is only 1, you will be able to have a large amount of them in your Clan Castle, making them more time consuming to lure out.
However, since the introduction of the
Poison Spell, low-hitpoint units such as the Barbarian are significantly less effective inside Clan Castles .</p>


<p><p><h4><b>Upgrade Differences<br></b></h4><br>

The Barbarian undergoes significant changes at levels 5, 6 and 7.
Initially, the Barbarian appears to be a short, muscular man wearing a brown kilt with a leather belt and a steel shield-shaped buckle. He also has spiked wristbands on both arms, as well as a short claymore in his right hand. He wears a pair of leather sandals on his feet.
At level 3, the Barbarian gains a brown leather headband with an emblem on the center, and a bigger, longer claymore.
At level 5, the Barbarian’s headband is replaced with a horned helmet and his claymore turns into bronze.
At level 6, the Barbarian wields a dark iron claymore and sports a mightier horned helmet of a dark gray color and gray horns pointing downward, similar to that of the Master League symbol. All accouterments (kilt, belt, wristbands, and sandals) turn a darker shade of brown as well.
At level 7, the Barbarian replaces the dark claymore with a lighter-gray one that appears to be molten on each edge, and his horned helmet gains a gold accent along with gold horns. The spiked bracelets on his wrists turn black, and the spikes become gold.</p>

<center><H5>Archer</h5></center>
<p>The Archer is a female warrior with sharp eyes. She wears a short, light green dress, a hooded cape, a leather belt, and an attached small pouch. She has a quiver slung on her back, a gold shortbow in her left hand, and a golden band on each of her upper arms.
She is the first ranged troop unlocked in the Barracks, and the second overall
troop unlocked in the game.
Archers have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building to them. However, once they become aware of enemy Clan Castle
troops, Heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons (either by being attacked themselves or being near another friendly troop under attack), they will leave their previously targeted building and engage the enemy
troops instead. Once all of the nearby enemy troops are defeated, they will proceed to attack the nearest building from their current location.</p><br>


<b><h4>Offensive Strategy</h4></b>
<img src="0c8e11b167215ddc06511ea852ea5a64.jpg" align="left">

<p>Archers are very weak when under fire but have a long range and can attack over Walls . Their low health makes them vulnerable to nearly all defenses , but Mortars , Wizard Towers and even Bombs are especially dangerous as they deal splash damage which can take out groups of Archers quickly. This can be alleviated by placing them in several small groups so that one or a few hits does not kill all of your Archers.
Archers work well when deployed in large numbers. However, it's a good idea to spread them out so that a Mortar or Wizard Tower cannot kill them with a single shot. This strategy is called an Archer Rush.
Due to the Archer's low health, some people find it useful to use
Barbarians or Giants as a distracting unit or "meat shield" in order to draw fire away from them.
Even at higher levels, using solely Archers and Barbarians has a chance (albeit small) of getting 2 stars (50% damage and destroyed Town Hall ). Rarely does this combination wipe a base entirely.
The Mortar's blind spot is smaller than the Archer's range, so they aren't safe from any tower except Air Defenses .
Another strategy is to try out dead spots. Deploy one Archer for each building and see if you get hit by any defenses. With this tactic you will be able to destroy a lot of buildings and get a lot of loot without much loss. Additionally, you can go for the 50% damage and get one star by taking risks and destroying a few more buildings.
They are good to take out lone buildings, like Builder's Huts placed far away to prevent full destruction.
Putting a handful of Archers on one defensive building where only that building can attack the group is usually successful, but should only be done depending on the level of both your Archers and the defending building.
When the Archer Queen uses her Royal Cloak ability, she summons up to twelve Archers equal to the level of Archers you have researched in the Laboratory .
Archers are expendable and have a very low cost, so you can deploy a few archers around an enemy base to set off some suspicious traps like Giant Bombs so you can deploy other troops safely.</p>
<b><h4>Defensive Strategy</h4></b>
She is an excellent troop to have in the
Clan Castle because she can target both
Air and Ground Units . Like all low health
troops, however, she is vulnerable to
Lightning Spells and Poison Spells ; if your enemy successfully lures them out of your Clan Castle, he/she can wipe out all of your Archers with a single Lightning Spell or Poison Spell. You can make it more difficult to lure them out by locating your Clan Castle deep in the interior of your base.
If she is behind a Wall when enemy melee Troops without a favorite target notice her, those troops will start attacking the Wall in order to reach her. Unfortunately, she will often forget to stay behind the wall and begin attacking the
Troops in open space.<br>
<b><h4>Upgrade Differences</b></h4>
<p>Upon first receiving the Archer, her hair is pink, and her quivered arrows are fletched with pink feathers.
At level 3 & 4, the Archer’s hair turns purple and has a quiver full of flaming arrows.
At level 5, the Archer’s hair turns back to pink, but she now wears her hood up. She has a quiver full of lightning arrows.
At level 6, the Archer's hair switches back to a slightly darker shade of purple that grows slightly longer. She gains a tiara and the arrows have purple fletchings. Her cape also turns from green to black.
At level 7, the Archer gains a small black crystal, similar to that of level eight walls on her tiara, which she wears untucked. Her cape becomes lined with a gold fabric and her quiver receives gold trim. Her arrows flame up whenever they are shot.</p>




<HR>
<center><H5>Goblin</h5></center>
<p>The Goblin is the fourth troop unlocked in the Barracks.
The Goblin is the fastest ground unit in the game.
The Goblin's first target is Resource Buildings , making them the ideal troop to deploy if your primary concern from a raid is collecting resources. In fact, there is a whole strategy involved around their use, named milking. Some good strategy forum threads can be found here .
The Goblin deals double damage to
Resource Buildings , Town Halls and Clan Castles , Gold Mines , Elixir Collectors ,
Dark Elixir Drills and storages for each). This means that he deals more than twice as much damage as Barbarians and three times as much as Archers to these types of buildings. The trade-off is his relatively low health, which is higher than an Archer 's but lower than a Barbarian 's.
Because the nature of the character is to attack Resource Buildings first (ignoring all defenses ) they can be vulnerable to attack and should not be deployed without another type of troop (such as the Giant or Barbarians ) as a meat shield.
Goblins prioritize resource buildings above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and
troops while any resource buildings remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy
Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize resources, Goblins consider the Clan Castle or the Town Hall to be
resource buildings regardless of whether or not they contain loot; Goblins will preferentially target them in addition to causing double damage to them.
Once all resource buildings are destroyed, Goblins become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby.</p>
<b><h4>Offensive Strategy</b></h4>
<img src="goblin-thumb.jpg" align="right">
<p>Goblins are great for stealing resources. First, use Wall Breakers to clear a route to Storages and Mines /Collectors . Then, use
Barbarians , Giants or any other higher-health units to distract Mortars and
Wizard Towers while the Goblins deplete the resources. Or you can simply destroy the splash-damage defenses first.
An alternative to Wall Breakers is the
Jump Spell, which helps guide Goblins over the walls and directly into the riches inside, however this is much more expensive.
Like Archers , the Goblin's greatest weakness is splash-damaging structures (i.e. Wizard Towers , Mortars ). Most
Wizard Towers and Mortars can kill Goblins in one shot. To combat this, send in Goblins in waves rather than spawning them all at once. Alternatively, you could send in Giants and Barbarians and let them serve as distractions while the Goblins get the resources .
Another good strategy is to place a couple of Goblins after the defenses are destroyed to help clean up any remaining buildings before time runs out. Since they are fast, they can speed over to buildings far away from each other. And if there are resources in the center, the Goblins will go right to it and ignore the other buildings.
Goblins are excellent at triggering Traps (especially Bombs ), as their movement speed can allow them to get out of range before it detonates. This is especially helpful in the Single Player Campaign where there are often a large number of
Bombs in predictable places.
You can also spawn Goblin hordes, for their attack speed and power can destroy many buildings. When all resource buildings have been destroyed, they will attack anything.
Goblins can trigger Spring Traps without dying unless they stop on top of the
Spring Trap .
Goblins are usually not viewed as a good
troop for getting Trophies , however they can be useful in small amounts.
For example, if you are doing a revenge and you think your units might go to the sides instead of into the middle because of resource buildings outside the Walls , you can use 5 Goblins per resource building to clear the way for your troops so they go in the middle.
Also, Goblins can be useful at the end of attacks. If you didn't get to 50% and all your other troops died you may be able to use Goblins to destroy a few
mines and collectors to get you over 50%.
If your main attack missed the Town Hall but destroyed most of the defenses nearby then goblins are perfect for picking up another star for the attack.
Goblins are a great choice as clean up
Troops for War attacks for Town Hall 8-9 players since majority of the leftover buildings are Resource Buildings which makes Goblins extremely effective to prevent time shortage.
Because Goblins also target the Town Hall , they can be useful for destroying the
Town Hall while defenses are distracted by other units to obtain a star.</p>
<b><h4>Defensive Strategy</b></h4>
Although generally not viewed as the best defensive troop, Goblins are still useful as Clan Castle troops. As there are no resources to target, Goblins will attack the enemy very quickly compared to the other troops.
Goblins have the highest damage of any of the low health troops and can engage the enemy units quickly due to their fast movement speed. They are particularly proficient at taking out small numbers of
Giants on defense.
When designing your base to defend against Goblins, it is useful to place your
defenses strategically to cover all
resource buildings . Most importantly, make sure your Wizard Towers and
Mortars are within range, as otherwise Goblins will make short work of your
Resources .
<b><h4>Upgrade Differences</b></h4>
<p>
The Goblin undergoes a significant change at level 5.
Upon first receiving the Goblin his appearance is that of a small, green creature with large pointy ears, red eyes with green pupils and a red-tipped nose. The Goblin wears red suspenders, brown pants and shoes. He also has a large sack, ostensibly for carrying resources stolen from your enemy.
At level 3 & 4, the Goblin’s bag receives light brown stripes on the sides of it.
At level 5, the Goblin’s bag turns all light brown and he gains a red mohawk.
At level 6, the Goblins gain a red leather cape and a golden necklace.
At level 7, the goblins mohawk turns bright orange and becomes squared off at the back.</p>

<center><img src="healer-thumb.jpg"></center>
<HR>



<center><H5>Wizard</h5></center>
</p>The Wizard is a magical unit that wears a hooded cloak, a leather belt with golden buckle and matching boots.
The Wizard is very similar to the Archer in that he uses a ranged attack and can shoot over Walls . He shoots fireballs or energy blasts that do high damage, but requires support as he has relatively low hitpoints and can easily be killed by point defenses. Wizards are commonly used in large groups for fire support or as a force multiplier (similar to Archers ), but they can also be effective in smaller numbers, especially at lower levels.
Wizards have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building to them. However, once they become aware of enemy Clan Castle
troops, Heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons (either by being attacked themselves or being near another friendly troop under attack), they will leave their previously targeted building and engage the enemy
troops instead. Once all of the nearby enemy troops are defeated, they will proceed to attack the nearest building from their current location.</p>
<b><h4>Offensive Strategy</b></h4>

<img src="wizard-thumb.jpg" align="left">
<p>Wizards have high enough health to survive a few splash damage attacks, but point defenses can present a significant problem. Due to their inability to withstand sustained fire, Wizards are primarily used behind more durable
troops such as Giants or P.E.K.K.As (or supported with Healer(s) ).
A good strategy to wipe out buildings quickly is to use Giants as a meat shield that are supported by Healers , while Wizards do the damage.
Their ability to attack over Walls make them very useful for attacking from the outside of Walls , or attacking from a distance without the danger of being caught in a Mortar or Wizard Tower blast.
Barbarians can be used as a meat shield to support Wizards, but be careful, as Wizards can still be affected by Mortars and Wizard Towers due to their splash damage.
Wizards can be very effective at taking out defenses; their very high damage makes turret hit points no match for them. However, to maximize their effectiveness, it is generally considered a good idea to deploy them in decent-sized groups, along with a few
P.E.K.K.As , Giants or Golems as a good distraction.
Wizards are amazing at clearing out an enemy's Clan Castle Troops. Their ability to do high amounts splash damage allows them to kill a lot of Troops at once. Deploying a Wizard or two after the
Clan Castle Troops have engaged you can be a good alternative to a Lightning Spell.
A strong technique for Town Hall 6 or 7 is to use 2 Healers to support a large group of Wizards. This way, the point-defenses would have to target one Wizard at a time to kill it (i.e. 3 Cannons shooting at the same Wizard) which is very unlikely; splash damage cannot kill the Wizards since they simply cannot out-damage the two Healers , especially when the defenses are low-leveled.
Although Wizards do incredible damage and take only 4 housing spaces, they are very vulnerable to Giant Bombs and
Spring Traps and Bombs if they're in groups of 3 or more. To prevent a large amount of wizards from dying, spread them along the line of fire and don't spawn them in one place immediately.
At Town Hall level 8 and above, Wizards are great funneling troops for high level strategies involving Golems .</p>
</b></h4>Defensive Strategy</b></h4>
<p>Wizards are excellent defensive Troops, as they can attack enemy Troops from behind Walls . If attacking Troops notice a Wizard emerging from the Clan Castle they will turn to attack it, even if they have to destroy a Wall segment to reach it.
Wizards pose a bit of a threat in a castle. Their range allows them to attack from afar, and their speed makes it harder for them to be lured away. They can, at proper levels, deal huge damage to
Golems and completely wipe out Hog and
Giant hordes. Poison spells can be used, but at low levels they don't have, and at high levels Inferno Towers block out healing, while poison spells should be used against Heroes.
Be careful countering. Use troops with decent hit points and do splash damage.</p>
<b><h4>Upgrade Differences</b></h4>
<p>When first unlocked, the Wizard appears to be a man with a goatee and thick eyebrows. He wears a light blue hooded cloak, a leather belt and gold buckle, with gray pointed boots. He wears brown clothes under his coat, and his sleeves are rolled up. He attacks with fireballs.
At level 3, the Wizard's cloak changes from light blue to purple. His boots become bright purple as well. His tunic also becomes purplish in color.
At level 4, the Wizard starts attacking with purple fireballs. His projectile speed is also noticeably faster.
At level 5, the Wizard's cloak changes to dark blue, and his boots change from a purplish color to a blackish color, as well as his tunic.
At level 6, the Wizard's cloak changes to the color red-violet, his hood loses its lining and extends farther to shadow his face, his belt buckle becomes orange, and his eyes turn a shade of yellow. His boots also change to red-violet. His attacks change to searing orange energy blasts
At level 7 the color of his cloak becomes darker and his robes and hood have a golden lining instead of white. He shoots purple-orange crystal-like fireball.</p>

<center><H5>Ballon</h5></center>
<center><img src="balloon-thumb.jpg"></center>
<HR>
<center><h5>Dragon</h5></center>

<p>The Dragon is a fearsome flying unit and is capable of attacking both ground and air units . Unlike the Balloon , the Dragon is both ranged and deals splash damage, like the Wizard .
A Dragon does short-range splash damage when he attacks. This can only be noticed when used against Clan Castle Troops and Walls .
The purple Dragon icon shown in the
Barracks is actually a level 2 Dragon. The Dragon changes from green to purple after upgrading, matching its image in the Barracks.
Dragons have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building to them. However, once they become aware of enemy Clan Castle
troops, Heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons (either by being attacked themselves or being near another friendly troop under attack), they will leave their previously targeted building and engage the enemy
troops instead. Once all of the nearby enemy troops are defeated, they will proceed to attack the nearest building from their current location.</p>
</b></h4>Offensive Strategy</b></h4>
<img src="dragon-thumb.jpg">
<p>Most Dragon strategies involve taking out as many Air Defenses as possible with other units (infantry, Giants , etc.) or
Lightning Spells , as it is a significant weakness to this powerful unit.
The Rage Spell and Dragon is like bread and butter. So try using a Pure-Dragon army and the Rage Spell can be effective.
Try to place the dragons separately, as they will join on in the middle of the battle, when you have reached the base's center. Then put Rage Spell for mass destruction.
A powerful, but costly, strategy for Town Hall 7 and Town Hall 8 players (especially for Clan Wars ) uses a combination of Dragons and Balloons. Dragons can tank the Air Defenses and Wizard Towers while Balloons target the Defensive Buildings . Which spells to bring ultimately depend on the layout of the defending base - an attacker should have a plan to destroy every Air Defense , whether that involves extra Balloons , Lightning Spells ,
Healing Spells , or Rage Spells .
Dragons are mostly used to get Trophies and in war as their high cost doesn't make them great candidates for Elixir raiding.
When using mass Dragon raids one should be careful of Buildings in the corners because their relatively slow movement speed does not make it great for moving around from corner to corner. To prevent this, attackers should bring some Barbarians or Minions or save their
Barbarian King to take out lone buildings in the corners; it might mean the difference between a 99% 2-star and a 100% 3-star raid.
If the Dragon appear to be jamming your defense, you can lure it out, then surround it. Due to its attack and movement speed, it will be overpowered soon.</p>
<b><h4>Defensive Strategy</b></h4>
<p>Dragons are one of the most powerful
Troops in the game, and as such it can be difficult to defend against them. Multiple high-level Air Defenses are critical for success against Dragons.
As a Town Hall 8 player, keeping your Air Defenses semi-spread while protecting them with Storages and other high hitpoint buildings is the key to preventing most 3-star attacks using Dragons. If the
Air Defenses are too close together, a single Rage Spell applied to a cluster of Dragons can quickly wipe out all three.
Dragons are wonderful Clan Castle
Troops . As a flying unit , the Dragon is completely immune to attacks from most
ground troops, and his splash damage capability makes it especially suited for destroying groups of Barbarians and
Goblins . His high health also helps him survive attacks from even multiple
Archers or Wizards (although a large group of either will usually be enough to destroy the Dragon). However, you can use spread your archers and wizards in a semi or whole circle around the dragon. This exploits the fact that dragons have a slow hit speed.</p>
<b><h4>Upgrade Differences</b></h4>
The Dragon encounters major graphic changes at every level.
Level 1 Dragons have green-colored skin and black eyes.
At level 2, the Dragon's skin turns from green to purple, matching his image in the Barracks. His eyes also turn the color of elixir.
At level 3, the Dragon's skin changes again to dark greenish-brown.
At level 4, the Dragon's skin turns a deep red; as part of the update announcement, Supercell referred to it as the new "ancient red dragon." His eyes also start flaming.
At level 5, the Dragon's skin turns into a brownish-crimson color. It also obtains golden horns near the back of its head and spikes on its back. Its wings also gets larger.
At level 6, the Dragon's skin turns dark crimson in color. The edges of its wings take on a reddish shade.

<center><H5>Peeka</h5></center>

<p>P.E.K.K.A is the 10th troop to be unlocked in the standard Barracks. She has the strongest armor of any of the
Elixir-based troops, and has the highest damage of any normal troops in the game. However, she is also the most expensive Elixir troop of all.
She has purple crystal spikes growing out of the side of her head, and carries a sword (multiple swords at higher levels).
P.E.K.K.As have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building to them. However, once they become aware of enemy Clan Castle troops , Heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons (either by being attacked themselves or being near another friendly
troop under attack), they will leave their previously targeted building and engage the enemy troops instead. Once all of the nearby enemy troops are defeated, they will proceed to attack the nearest building from their current location.</p>
<b><h4>Offensive Strategy</b></h4>
<img src="22cc5316986505a09b75d1bd8176e857.jpg">
<p>Because this Troop has the highest attack of all normal units in the game along with very high health, it is advisable to deploy them in pairs on each corner of the opponent's village or near a bunch of enemy defensive buildings . Most buildings won't survive two attacks of this very powerful unit (600-950 damage per hit depending on level), meaning two P.E.K.K.As should destroy most buildings in a single hit from both units. By deploying in pairs, Mortars won't be as effective either, as they can only damage one pair at a time as opposed to an entire group of P.E.K.K.As deployed together. Nevertheless, if the opponent's village has maximum level Walls , it may be best to deploy larger groups of P.E.K.K.As. This way, they will be able to break through the Walls with one hit.
Never train a complete P.E.K.K.A army as they will be helpless against flying
Clan Castle troops.</p>
<b><h4>Defensive Strategy</b></h4>
<p>P.E.K.K.A is not affected by Spring Traps , due to taking up more than 15 housing space. However, she will still trigger them, and the defender will still have to re-arm them.
P.E.K.K.A is a gamble as a Clan Castle troop because of her inability to deal splash damage or attack air, which leaves her an easy target for air troops or even swarms of Wizards. However, against an unsuspecting attacker, who often assumes that whatever is inside has to be a Dragon , she can occasionally surprise the attacker by one-shotting any heroes that come too close to her as well as delaying their troops for a good amount owing to her tremendous hit points.
Because P.E.K.K.A has a slow attack speed, she is not effective against massed infantry. Large numbers (at least 15) of Barbarians and/or Archers can easily take her out. Alternatively, one can either use a Witch or a Minion ; with the former, her Skeletons will distract P.E.K.K.A indefinitely because she will summon more Skeletons before P.E.K.K.A finishes off the remaining ones. With the latter, her inability to attack air units means that you can simply deploy minions as they slowly kill the defending P.E.K.K.A.
Skeleton Traps set to Ground Mode can distract P.E.K.K.A for several seconds.</p>
<b><h4>Upgrade Differences</b></h4>
P.E.K.K.A undergoes significant visual changes at levels 3, 4 and 5.
P.E.K.K.A's sword changes color based on her level.
At level 2, her sword turns to an elixir-colored pink.
At level 3, P.E.K.K.A's armor and sword changes from dark blue to black, the sword and horn's glow becomes red.
At level 4, P.E.K.K.A obtains another sword and her horns become pink again.
At level 5, P.E.K.K.A's armor color changes from black to dark navy and her swords turn gold. However, the spikes and the sword hilts still stay the same. The swords now appear to have a pink "aura". Her eyes have a faint pink glow.

<center><H5>MINER</h5></center>
<center><img src="Miner_Thumb.jpg" width="300" height="300"></center>
<P>Miners were one of the latest troops to be introduced, and although there are some people that love their mass Miner attacks, especially TH 11’s, they are not really a highly-used troop in the game. Even though Clash of Clans lowered the training time by a lot, it still not really worth it to use them. They have a lot of hitpoints and can also avoid damage while they are underground “mining,” but they deliver a very small amount of damage. This makes them kind of a hybrid troop for distraction and destruction, not really specializing in either aspect.</P>

<center><H5>Minions</h5></center>
<center><img src="minion-thumb.jpg"></center><HR>

<center><H5>Hog raider</h5></center>
<p>The Hog Rider is a rugged, dark-skinned man with a mohawk riding a large hog. He is bare-chested, wearing only a brown leather loincloth, a red belt and a pair of leather sandals. He has two large golden wristbands and a gold earring. His weapon of choice is a large warhammer.
His mount is a large boar/hog, about half its rider's height; the Hog Rider holds a brown leather bridle which is looped around the boar's tusks.
Because of his mount, the Hog Rider can jump over Walls , giving the user a great advantage over the enemy base.
Although he has high damage per second and moderate hit points, he only takes 2 minutes to train.
Hog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and
troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle
troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses , Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden to be a defensive building.
Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby.</p>
<b><h4>Offensive Strategy</b></h4>
<img src="hogrider-thumb.jpg">
<p>He can be used to jump over any level
Walls , rendering them ineffective against Hog Riders. Note that while this allows Hog Riders free access to what lies behind the wall, it does not open up gaps for other troops to move through. If the Hog Riders need the support of other
ground troops, you will still need to deploy Wall Breakers, a Jump Spell or
Earthquake Spells in order to assist them.
The Hog Rider could potentially be used in an extremely effective fashion similar to Barbarians , i.e. a "Hog Rider Rush", without requiring any Wall Breakers to break Walls . However, this would likely be a poor tradeoff of resources, as a large raid of Hog Riders would cost a significant amount of Dark Elixir.
Hog Riders are quite capable of acting as distracting troops like Giants ; they have nearly as much health as a similar-level
Giant , move twice as quickly and do considerably more damage.
They work well with the Healing Spell when you group several of them together.
A good tactic for using Healing Spells is to place them strategically on a cluster of defenses (at least about 3 or more) and also deploy them shortly before the Hog Riders arrive in the area, i.e. deploy them ahead of the Hog Riders. This is so that the Hog Riders get the most out of the Healing Spell, and destroy the defenses without losing too much HP.
Spots where a Giant Bomb or a pair of
Giant Bombs may be lurking should be given special attention when deploying Healing Spells . Hogs of the same level as the Giant Bomb will survive a single Giant Bomb , but they're helpless against a pair of Giant Bombs even with a Healing Spell. Heal them after they've went through a
Giant Bomb blast.
The Hog Rider is the one of the best troop types for drawing out Clan Castle troops, as it can avoid Walls to penetrate deep enough to reach centrally-placed Clan Castles (and enough health to not die before it gets there). Deploy one or a few to trigger the Clan Castle troops, then lure the reinforcement troops to the corner side, and deploy multiple
Archers or Wizards to slaughter them, and then deploy the remainder of your Hog Riders. This strategy is especially effective during Clan War raids. However,
skeletons from the Skeleton Trap and
Heroes can also easily kill the Hog Riders, as they can only target defenses , so make sure to have some troops that target anything.
Hog Riders are helpless against airborne enemy Clan Castle troops, especially
Dragons . Most mass Hog Rider strategies in Clan Wars require that the Clan Castle troops be killed first by luring. Bring other troops in addition to Hog Riders, such as
Wizards, to deal with enemy Clan Castle troops and do clean up.
Poison Spells can be used to kill almost any enemy Clan Castle troop, but beware as the troops will attempt to flee the poison. If the Poison Spells are decently leveled and you effectively keep the Clan Castle troops from escaping the Poison spell with distracting troops, they can eliminate almost any troop.
A Poison Spell can be used to dispense of those pesky skeletons risen from the Skeleton Traps and even the lower health Clan Castle troops (such as Archers and Wizards).
With multiple Poison Spells, it is possible to eliminate troops with higher health, especially Dragons . Just be sure to drop each Poison Spell only after the previous one has worn off.
Time is also a factor to consider. With only 3 minutes in an attack, it is essential to make sure that this whole process, and the remainder of the attack is done as quickly as possible to avoid running out of time.</p>
<b><h4>Defensive Strategy</b></h4>
<p>Defending against Hog Riders is tricky, as their ability to bypass Walls renders them irrelevant. However, the fact that they can jump over walls and attack defenses means that they may leave behind their ground support (such as Barbarians , etc.), as they will not be able to follow. This will allow your interior defenses to concentrate on the Hog Riders.
Another way to defend against Hog Riders is to exploit the fact that they will attack the closest defensive building. You can arrange your base in such a way so that you have high-powered defenses on the inside and lower-powered defense on the outside, with a layer of resources in between. That way, the Hogs will (in theory) complete a loop around your base before being able to attack your interior defenses ( Inferno Towers , X-Bows , etc.), by which time they should have all been killed by the interior
defenses .
You can place Spring Traps in between Defensive Buildings to take out a few Hog Riders at a time; good usage of multiple Spring Traps can severely hinder a Hog Rider rush.
Hog Riders can be easily killed using "forced pathing". Forced pathing is a strategy that manipulates the Hog Rider AI and make them go to at least 2
Defenses that cannot be prevented by surgical dropping or side clearing. Placing a set of Giant Bombs in between the two can most certainly guarantee you a defensive win.
Clan Castle troops, Heroes , and Skeleton Traps set to Ground Mode can be an annoyance to mass Hog Rider raids, as Hog Riders will not attack them unless all
defensive buildings have been destroyed. Make sure to centralize them if you want to beat Hog Riders.
In Clan Wars , Dragons are excellent troops to place in Clan Castles against Hog Riders, especially for Town Halls 8 and 9. They have high HP, meaning they won't die easily, and can kill mass quantities of Hog Riders swiftly if not properly lured. Most mass Hog Rider strategies require that the enemy Clan Castle troops be killed first, so if the attacker lures out a
Dragon , but fails to kill it, then a 3-star win is next to impossible, much less a 1-star win via destroying 50% of the buildings.
Multi-target Inferno Towers can be a severe hindrance to Hog Riders, being able to block out healing effects, having high HP to take several hits from Hog Riders, while hitting large groups of them.
Although the Hog Rider is certainly not a liability on defense, the fact that all defensive troops are unimpeded by walls negates the primary advantage of the Hog Rider. As of the 30 Jul 2013 update, they take up the same amount of housing space (5) as Giants but are much faster and do considerably more damage. They are also much less susceptible to Lightning Spell attacks than troops with small hitpoints, so they may be a good alternative for the Clan Castle if your clanmates don't mind donating Dark Elixir Troops.</p>
<b><h4>Upgrade Differences</b></h4>
Initially, the Hog Rider is a dark-skinned man with a black mohawk and beard. He also has a gold earring in his right ear and sports two heavy golden wristbands, a red belt, and a brown loincloth. The Hog Rider's hammer has two brass bands.
At level 3, his hammer increases in size and turns black. The brass bands on the hammer's head disappear, and the hammer head goes further down onto the stick, creating a button looking object on the top of the hammer head.
At level 5, his mohawk turns from black to orange, making it similar to that of a level 5 Goblin .
At level 6, his hammer gains three large, golden spikes.
At level 7, the edges of his hammer starts to glow red, and he gains a brown headband, but reverts to a black mohawk.

<center><H5>Valkyrie</h5></center>




<p>The Valkyrie is a fierce warrior with flaming crimson hair, dressed in a long leather loincloth with matching leather brassiere and knee-high boots. She wields a massive double-bladed axe, which is about half of her size.
The Valkyrie has a total of 5 levels.
She takes up 8 spaces in an Army Camp.
Valkyries have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building to them. However, once they become aware of enemy Clan Castle
troops, Heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons (either by being attacked themselves or being near another friendly troop under attack), they will leave their previously targeted building and engage the enemy
troops instead. Once all of the nearby enemy troops are defeated, they will proceed to attack the nearest building from their current location.</p>
<b><h4>Offensive Strategy</b></h4>
<img src="valkyrie-thumb.jpg">
<p>Drop the Valkyries near the defending
Barbarian King at the start of an attack. These Dark Elixir Troops do a lot of damage on Heroes and are an easy way to get rid of the Barbarian King early; this makes the whole attack easier and much more effective.
Using the Valkyrie against Clan Castle troops is a good idea, because they deal small area splash damage and will be able to take out groups of troops quickly and efficiently.
The way Valkyries attack is by getting at least between two buildings and damages both at the same time. But if the buildings are not close to each other, then watch out for Traps hidden around them. (e.g. A Barracks near another one around a hidden Bomb .)
Valkyries will immediately move to a different target right after killing an enemy troop or building , therefore resetting its attack pattern with little to no delay. Potentially attacking ten times every second as long as she keeps on one-shotting melee enemy troops such as a Barbarian.
Valkyries are a worthy substitute for
P.E.K.K.A in high level attacks. They are relatively tanky, not as vulnerable to
Hidden Teslas and much faster than
P.E.K.K.As . Their ability to eliminate Clan Castle troops, Heroes and the core of a defending village with their area of effect attack is impressive and their effectiveness when paired with Healing Spells is also favorable when compared to P.E.K.K.As .
Valkyries, when granted access to the core of the base, can destroy it with no problem. Help them get to the core with your Jump Spells and assist them with
Rage, Clone , and Freeze Spells once they are inside.</p>
<b><h4>Defensive Strategy</b></h4>
<p>Valkyries are extremely powerful troops and can be a problem to deal with; they do a lot of damage and have quite a bit of health (although nowhere near as much as a Dragon , P.E.K.K.A or Golem). Since her damage has a splash component, she can damage multiple
Buildings at once. Thus it is not advised to group buildings together.
One exception is putting an Army Camp and another building together, as the Army Camp 's hitbox is different from other buildings, as it does not extend out to the outside of the building, but can only be damaged at the center.
Whenever Valkyries destroy a building, they will reposition themselves, which during that time, they could get shot down. Try to put buildings with different hitpoints together to hinder a Valkyrie army.
Valkyries are wonderful Clan Castle troops. Their splash damage makes them extremely effective against large groups of lightly-armored, melee-range troops such as Barbarians and Goblins, though they are also very capable against groups of ranged troops such as Archers and even Wizards as well. On several occasions players have reported Valkyries to have single-handedly destroyed entire
Goblin and Barbarian raids. She can only attack ground troops , however, and is completely ineffective against aerial units . Her moderate health allows her to survive a few hits.
The Valkyrie is now much more vulnerable to the Poison Spell.
The Valkyrie is particularly deadly when deployed among Barbarians as part of the Clan Castle complement; although she is a much more powerful troop , she is approximately the same size and can easily be missed in a group of Barbarians . Often it will take a few moments for the attacking player to notice her and understand why his or her ground troops are dying so quickly.
The Valkyrie attacks nearby buildings that are close to each other such as a Barracks near another one, so put Traps around those buildings while making them close to each other as possible to deal damage or rid them.</p>
<b><h4>Upgrade Differences</b></h4>
Initially, the Valkyrie is a tall skinny woman with a steel axe. She wears a bra-like chest cover and a cloth covering her lower half.
At level 3, the Valkyrie changes her steel axe for a golden one.
At level 5, the Valkyrie wears a black furry tunic similar to the level 6 Giant

<center><H5>Golem</h5></center>




<p>The Golem is unlocked once the Dark Barracks is upgraded to level 4.
The Golem is the most expensive Dark Elixir troop.
Golems are extremely powerful tanking units that, upon death, split into two smaller Golemites that continue to do damage.
Both Golems and Golemites do splash damage, similar to Balloons and Lava Hounds , when destroyed.
Golems prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and
troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle
troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses , Golems do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden to be a defensive building.
Once all defenses are destroyed, Golems become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby.</p>
<b><h4>Offensive Strategy</b></h4>
<img src="golem-thumb.jpg">
<p>A good strategy is to release Golems and wait until all splash damage defenses like
Mortars and Wizard Towers fire on them then release units like Archers and
Barbarians .
Since the Golems do small amounts of damage themselves, it´s important that they are backed up by high damage-dealing troops, like Wizards or Witches .
Golems aren't affected by Spring Traps . However, when one becomes two
Golemites, the Golemites will be affected by Spring Traps if they encounter them.
If possible, destroy the Inferno Tower that is set on Single Target Mode as quickly as possible. Otherwise, they will wipe out your Golems. However, this is usually preferable to the Inferno Tower targeting a P.E.K.K.A , Barbarian King , or Archer Queen . A Freeze Spell can be used to temporarily disable the Inferno Tower and "reset" its damage. If the Inferno Tower is set on Multiple Target Mode, it will not be much of a problem to the Golem, although it is still a nuisance to the troops attempting to use the Golem as a meat shield.</p>
<b><h4>Defensive Strategy</b></h4>
<p>Golems, similar to Giants and Lava Hounds , are very high-health units that can be used to soak up fire (meat shields). Make sure that the Golem is in the middle or in range of most of your defenses, as the Golem can distract attacking troops very effectively for a considerable amount of time. Even when overwhelmed, the Golem does a surprising amount of splash damage, enough to kill all low-health units (including lower-level Giants ), as well as even Hog Riders . Any remaining attackers will then have to deal with the two Golemites as well.
Golems tend not to be in Clan Castles due to their high storage space, 30, which fills up a Level 5 Clan Castle by itself. Additionally, its damage output as well as speed are very low and its health can be undermined by Wizards. However, they make potentially good distractions, especially against the likes of low health troops.</p>
<b><h4>Upgrade Differences</b></h4>
The Golem undergoes a significant graphic change at level 5.
Initially, the Golem is a light gray shaded rock. The Golem has bright, elixir colored eyes with a slight glow.
At level 3, the Golem's rocky exterior changes shade from a light gray to a darker gray. The eyes also become a darker purple with a slightly more significant glow.
At level 5, the Golem gains purple, crystal-like spikes, quite similar to those on the level 3 Wizard Tower, and his entire body gains a purple/gray color. The eye color does not change but glows slightly stronger.
At level 6, some of the Golem's crystal-like spikes change color to grayish-pink. Some more crystal-like spikes grow on his shoulders.

<center><H5>Bowler</h5></center>

<p>The Bowler is a deadly troop that throws a large boulder that bounces once dealing splash damage on the initial bounce and dealing splash damage when it lands.
The Bowler is the first ground troop that's capable of attacking more than one target with splash damage in a straight line.
Bowlers have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building to them. However, once they become aware of enemy Clan Castle
troops, Heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons (either by being attacked themselves or being near another friendly troop under attack), they will leave their previously targeted building and engage the enemy
troops instead. Once all of the nearby enemy troops are defeated, they will proceed to attack the nearest building from their current location.</p>
<b><h4>Offensive Strategy</b></h4>
<img src="FB_IMG_14805477301711662.jpg" height="500">
<p>The Bowler doesn't have a lot of hitpoints so it can be taken out when not protected, so be sure it is behind tanks like Golems or Giants .
The Bowler can be a great unit for funneling due to their ability to be able to hit 2 structures at any given time. This allows better funneling compared to using Wizards.</p>
<b><h4>Defensive Strategy</b></h4>
<p>The Bowler has splash damage similar to the Wizard. But unlike the Wizard, the Bowler can reach deeper through the opponent's Troops allowing the Bowlers to take out damaging units such as
Wizards, Witches and the Heroes .</p>
<b><h4>Upgrade Differences</b></h4>
At initial level, the Bowler is a blue muscular humanoid creature that wears a loincloth around his waist bound to him with rope and carries a large boulder in the shape of a bowling ball. He has pointed ears and red, sunken eyes. His hands and feet resemble those of a
Giant . He also has a yellow band on both arms.
At level 3, the Bowler's skin becomes a slightly darker blue like the level 3 Minion , and the boulder gains pink, elixir colored crystals sticking out of it, similar to the level 5 Golem.
